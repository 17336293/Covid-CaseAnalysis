# Covid-CaseAnalysis
One of my first major data analysis project I undertook while in college for the module COMP47350. I have delayed uploading this as I was concerned future students might plagiarize my assignment. 

It is divided into two parts: 

Part 1: Looks at cleaning and preparing the data

Part 2: Looks at trying to model and predict if a patient is going to die of covid.
